# Non-Negotiable Constraints

The following constraints must NEVER be violated:

- The app must not handle money
- The app must not process payments
- The app must not track poker winnings
- The app must not enforce buy-ins
- The app must not facilitate gambling

If a feature request violates these constraints,
the implementation should be rejected or redesigned.
